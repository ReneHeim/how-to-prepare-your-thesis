# how-to-prepare-your-thesis
Templates and guidelines for planning and writing scientific theses, with examples for GIS and vegetation science. Includes IMRAD structure, research question and hypothesis development, data management, and best practices for students.

## Topic
*Briefly justify the relevance of your topic (practical and scientific motivation). Think about the "why" behind their choice.*

Example: Spatio-Temporal Wildfire Patterns

## Research Questions and Hypothesis
*Be as specific as possible when stating your questions and relate each question to a potential method or data source. This will help later when approaching your analysis and method section.*

Research Question:
•	How do topographic features and climatic variables interact to influence wildfire frequency and intensity in Mediterranean ecosystems?
Hypotheses:
•	H1 (Proposes a specific effect/relationship between variables.): South-facing slopes with >15° incline will show 30% higher fire recurrence than north-facing aspects due to lower soil moisture
•	H0 (Assumes no effect/no relationship exists between variables.): No significant correlation exists between annual precipitation variability and burned area size
Methods:
•	Spatial analysis: Kernel density heatmaps + logistic regression
Data: 
•	GIS layers: DEM (slope/aspect), climate grids (CHIRPS rainfall), EFFIS fire atlas

## Data Management Plan
A data management plan is essential because it ensures that research data are properly organized, securely stored, and well documented throughout the project, which supports data quality, reproducibility, and long-term preservation. By planning ahead, researchers can prevent data loss, facilitate collaboration, and make their data accessible for future reuse or publication. Also planning the necessary data volume is helpful.
•	What data will be used (e.g., remote sensing, field surveys, existing databases)?
•	How will data be accessed and managed (file formats, storage, backup)?
•	Any ethical or legal considerations (e.g., data privacy, licenses)?

## Thesis Structure
Draft a tentative table of contents, including main chapters and subheadings. This helps to visualize the flow of their argument and ensures all necessary components are included
A typical scientific thesis—especially in the natural sciences or applied fields like GIS and vegetation science—follows a well-established structure designed to guide the reader logically through your research. One of the most widely used formats is the IMRAD structure, which stands for Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. Many universities and disciplines use this as the backbone for thesis writing, often with additional sections for context and completeness.
General Thesis Structure (with IMRAD)
1.	Title Page
2.	Abstract
A concise summary of your research question, methods, main findings, and conclusions.
3.	Table of Contents
4.	Introduction
o	Presents the research topic and its relevance
o	States the research questions and objectives
o	Identifies gaps and relevance your study addresses
o	Ask yourself, what are the main characters in your movie?
5.	Methods (Materials and Methods)
o	Describes the study area, data sources, and analytical procedures
o	Explains how research questions and hypotheses are addressed
6.	Results
o	Presents findings objectively, often with tables, figures, and maps
o	No interpretation—just the facts
7.	Discussion
o	Interprets the results in the context of your research questions and hypotheses
o	Compares findings to previous studies
o	Addresses limitations and implications
8.	Conclusion
o	Summarizes key findings
o	Suggests future research directions and practical implications
9.	References
o	Full list of all sources cited
10.	Appendices (if needed)
o	Supplementary material, raw data, code, etc.

# Additional Information

## What is the IMRAD Method?
 
Figure 1. The hourglass IMRAD model illustrates how scientific writing moves from a broad, general context in the Introduction, narrows to specific methods and results at the center, and then widens again in the Discussion to connect findings back to the broader scientific field. This structure helps readers follow the logical flow from general background, through focused research, and back out to general implications and relevance (Source: https://moxielearn.ai/blog/crafting-research-articles-the-imrad-structure).

IMRAD stands for:
•	Introduction
•	Methods
•	Results
•	And
•	Discussion

This structure is widely used in scientific writing because it mirrors the logical flow of the research process:
•	Introduction: Sets the stage by presenting the problem, research questions, and objectives.
•	Methods: Details how the research was conducted, allowing for reproducibility.
•	Results: Objectively presents the findings of the study.
•	Discussion: Interprets the results, relates them to the broader field, and discusses implications.

Why IMRAD?
•	Clarity: Readers can quickly locate specific information.
•	Transparency: Methods and results are clearly separated, reducing bias.
•	Universality: Recognized and accepted across scientific disciplines.

# Introduction to the Scientific Method
The scientific method is a systematic, empirical approach to acquiring knowledge and understanding the world. It involves making careful observations, asking focused questions, forming testable hypotheses, collecting and analyzing data, and drawing conclusions based on evidence. This process helps minimize bias and ensures that findings are reliable and reproducible.

## Why Do We Ask Research Questions?
Research questions are the foundation of any scientific inquiry. They:
•	Define the scope and focus of a study, narrowing broad topics into specific, researchable issues.
•	Guide the selection of methods, data, and analysis by clarifying what the researcher aims to discover or explain.
•	Communicate the purpose and direction of the study to others.
A well-formulated research question ensures that the investigation is coherent and targeted, increasing the likelihood of meaningful results.

## Why Do We Formulate Hypotheses?
A hypothesis is a clear, testable statement predicting an outcome or explaining a relationship between variables. Hypotheses:
•	Provide a specific answer or explanation to the research question, based on theory or prior evidence.
•	Guide the design of experiments or analyses, specifying what will be tested and how.
•	Allow for empirical testing—researchers can collect data to support or refute the hypothesis, contributing to scientific knowledge.

## Is It Always Necessary to Have Both?
It is common, especially in quantitative research, to use both research questions and hypotheses: the research question frames what you want to know, and the hypothesis states what you expect to find. However, it is not always required to have both in every study:
•	Exploratory or qualitative research may focus on research questions without formal hypotheses, especially when little is known about the topic or when the goal is to describe or understand phenomena rather than test predictions.
•	Descriptive studies may use only research questions if the aim is to document patterns or trends without making predictions.
•	Quantitative or experimental studies typically benefit from both, as hypotheses provide a basis for statistical testing and interpretation.

In summary, research questions and hypotheses are complementary tools: questions identify what you want to explore, while hypotheses provide specific, testable predictions. Whether both are needed depends on your research goals, methods, and the state of knowledge in your field.
